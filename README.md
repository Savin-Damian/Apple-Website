# Apple-Website
## Structure and Content of the Project
The application was mainly created in HTML, with programming done directly in the source code. The command lines were written using Visual Studio Code, and the code can be viewed with any text editor.

Structurally, the first page (index.html) is organized using divs and tables. In the first row (table row), the animated menu is presented, from which you can choose: Home, Istorie, Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod, Galerie, Video, Bibliografie.

The main menu was created in HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), using primarily the Visual Studio Code editor.
